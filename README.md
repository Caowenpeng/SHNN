# SHNN
SHNN paper: 

## Code
This repository contains sample code to implement SHNN.  

MainFunction.py: it contains the code to train the model on the Sleep-EDFx dataset.

MainFunctionTest.py: it provides the code to test the trained model. third file.

Untils.py: it provides code to process .edf file data.

## Prepare dataset

We evaluated our SHNN Model with Sleep-EDFx dataset.

Sleep-EDFx data can be downloaded at: https://physionet.org/content/sleep-edfx/1.0.0/
